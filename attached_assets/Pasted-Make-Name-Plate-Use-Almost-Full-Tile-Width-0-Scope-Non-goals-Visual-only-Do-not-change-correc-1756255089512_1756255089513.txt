Make Name Plate Use (Almost) Full Tile Width
0) Scope / Non-goals

Visual only. Do not change correctness, scoring, rarity, or any validation logic.

Goal: The name plate (the dark rounded bar with the name) should use nearly the entire width of the tile on all devices (including iPhone 16), while still respecting avatar and badge safe zones.

1) Name plate width & positioning

Width target: Make the name plate fill ~92–96% of the tile’s inner width (choose a single value in that range and keep it consistent).

Leave a small side margin so the rounded corners don’t touch the tile edges.

Center it horizontally in the tile.

Bottom inset: Keep a small bottom margin (about 3–4% of tile width) so the plate doesn’t collide with the tile’s border radius.

Remove any artificial constraints that shrink the plate, such as:

fixed pixel widths,

max-width caps (e.g., 60–80%),

fit-content/min-content behavior that prevents full expansion,

transforms that scale the plate down.

The plate must remain a block-level element that can actually expand to the target width; do not let the avatar or badge define its width.

2) Text area inside the plate

Keep small, responsive horizontal padding inside the plate (about 1.5–2.5% of tile width per side) so the text doesn’t touch the edges.

The measured “fit” width for the text is the plate’s inner width (plate width minus padding). Use this as the bound for the dynamic font-fit algorithm.

3) Dynamic font sizing (integrate with our existing rules)

Use the auto-fit algorithm we already specified, but now it must target the larger, full-width plate:

Start from a higher maxFont because we have more width now (names should look bigger).

Check width AND height against the name band (the bottom region reserved for names).

Preserve the dynamic fit order (try each step at the largest font that fits before moving to the next):

One-line full: “F. Lastname”

Two-line full: line 1 F., line 2 Lastname (wraps only at spaces)

One-line truncated: F. + last name with end ellipsis

Two-line truncated: F. on line 1; truncated last name on line 2 with end ellipsis

No hyphenation. Never break mid-word; truncate only at the end of the last name.

Keep min/max font clamps so text remains legible on very small tiles and not cartoonishly large on huge tiles.

4) Safe zones (no overlaps)

The name band must never overlap the avatar or the top-right rarity badge.

If necessary on small tiles, prefer two-line modes (steps 2 or 4) to keep height inside the name band rather than shrinking the plate width.

5) Reflow & performance

Re-fit names whenever:

the grid/tile mounts,

avatar image loads,

the window is resized or orientation changes,

a new grid is generated.

Use a ResizeObserver on tiles, debounce ~50ms, and update in requestAnimationFrame to avoid jitter.

Cache computed font sizes by (tile size bucket, label length, mode) to avoid extra measuring.

6) Acceptance checklist (use this to verify on iPhone 16 + desktop)

Plate width visually fills ~92–96% of each tile. There’s only a narrow margin on the left/right.

“L. James” (and similar) appears larger and uses the wide plate; on iPhone it nearly spans the tile width.

Long names make the most of the width and only truncate when necessary, following the dynamic order.

No overlaps with the avatar or the top-right rarity badge, and no clipping on rounded corners.

Rotating the phone or resizing the browser reflows instantly with no jitter.

If the plate is still narrow after this change, check for any lingering CSS like max-width, inline-size, or a parent container that’s restricting width—remove those caps so the plate can expand to the target 92–96%.
