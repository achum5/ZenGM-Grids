“Why this was incorrect” Language

A) Core rule for the sentence

For a wrong guess at the intersection of two categories A and B, build the message from these rules:
	1.	Compute whether the player satisfies each category: meetsA and meetsB.
	2.	Compose the sentence using the smallest, clearest statement:

	•	If meetsA and not meetsB:
{Player} {affirm(A)} but {neg(B)}.
	•	If meetsB and not meetsA:
{Player} {affirm(B)} but {neg(A)}.
	•	If neither is met:
{Player} {neg(A)} and {neg(B)}.

Use sentence case, include thousands separators (e.g., 5,000+), keep the “+” symbol from the category labels, and use correct articles (“a/an”) and prepositions.

Example (Mike Conley):
“Mike Conley had 5,000+ career assists but was not a second-round pick.”

C) Output examples (structure)
	•	One met, one failed:
“Mike Conley had 5,000+ career assists but was not a second-round pick.”
“Jason Kidd was a first-round pick but never made a 50/40/90 season.”
	•	Both failed:
“Kyle Lowry did not have 10,000+ career rebounds and was not a second-round pick.”
“Al Horford never led the league in blocks and never scored 50+ points in a game.”
	•	Team + achievement:
“Chris Paul played for the Phoenix Suns but did not have 2,000+ career steals.”

⸻

D) Implementation notes
	•	Always use affirm() and neg() from the phrase dictionary above to keep grammar correct (avoid mistakes like “didn’t play for the 2nd Round Pick”).
	•	Use the joiners exactly as specified:
	•	“but” when one condition passes and the other fails.
	•	“and” when both fail.
	•	Keep the sentence short, declarative, and end with a period.
	•	Support internationalized number formatting later, but for now keep U.S. separators and the “+” sign as in labels.

⸻

Acceptance: The message for every wrong guess is grammatical, specific, and uses the correct verb (“played for”, “was”, “won”, “led”, “averaged”, “recorded”, “made”) for the category type; it never produces phrases like “played for the 2nd Round Pick.”


Hard constraint (do not change):
This update is purely visual. It must not change how the app determines whether a player met (not “let”) any requirement. The existing validation logic is already correct and must remain untouched.

What you must use (read-only):
	•	Continue relying on the existing results/flags from the validator (e.g., booleans like meetsA / meetsB, existing category outcomes).
	•	Treat those values as read-only inputs to the message composer. Do not recompute, reinterpret, or override them.

What you must not change:
	•	❌ Category/achievement evaluation logic
	•	❌ Correct/incorrect determination
	•	❌ Scoring, rarity calculations, or totals
	•	❌ Guess counting, remaining guesses, win/loss state
	•	❌ Any persistence or session logic

Scope of this change:
	•	✅ Replace only the text string shown in the “Why this was incorrect” UI, using the phrasing rules/phrase dictionary from the main brief.
	•	✅ Joiners (“but” vs “and”), grammar, and number formatting are presentation-only.

Acceptance:
	•	Given the same guess and the same underlying validation output, the result (correct/incorrect, score, rarity, etc.) is identical before and after this change.
	•	Only the explanation sentence changes, and it is grammatical (e.g., “Mike Conley had 5,000+ career assists but was not a second-round pick.”).
