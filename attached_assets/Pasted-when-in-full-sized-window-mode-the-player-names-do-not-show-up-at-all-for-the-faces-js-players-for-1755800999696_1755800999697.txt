when in full sized window mode, the player names do not show up at all for the faces.js players
for the imaged players, however, the names do show up if the name is short enough. if it is a long name, the name does not come up at all. i need you to do dynamic font size for player names depending on how long the name is
the full name should always show in the sqaure
when in smaller windowed mode, the names do come up as intended. so, for only full sized mode this needs to be resolved
but then for a small iphone, the font size of the player name needs to be lessened so the full name can still appear in the square

still getting this bug anytime i resize the window after having guessed a player with a faces.js face. please make sure this is resolved. if you need to just make the sizing of the faces.js faces static without changing, please do that. the current sizing is very good

add in all the new awards. its still not populating awards/info other than the basic stuff we started with
lets delete out all the award/stats/info data that we have in the code then import this exact list in to use as our pool to generate the grids with
the amount of rows/columns generation that have stats/awards should remain the same. that is functioning very well
