Name Plate Width Still Too Small (Fix)
0) Scope

Visual/layout only. Do not change correctness, scoring, rarity, or any validation logic.

1) Problem recap (from screenshot)

The name plate is still content-sized (shrinks to the text), not to the tile width.

It sits higher than expected and looks cramped; the text isn’t using the available width.

We previously “set 94% width,” but some parent/child style is overriding or constraining it.

2) What we want (definition of done)

The name plate fills ~94% of the tile’s inner width (within 92–96%), centered, with small left/right margins.

The text inside uses nearly that entire width and grows as large as possible while still fitting our name rules (no hyphenation, dynamic fit order).

The plate stays in the bottom band of the tile, never overlaps the avatar or rarity badge.

It looks correct on iPhone 16 and across desktop/tablet sizes.

3) Likely causes to remove (check all, remove any that exist)

Shrink-to-content styles on the plate or its container:

display: inline-flex, width: auto, max-width caps, or fit-content.

Parent constraints:

A parent wrapper with max-width, inline-size, gap, or padding that prevents full expansion.

Flexbox min-width trap:

Flex children default to min-width: auto → they won’t shrink. The label container needs min-width: 0 so text can properly fit/measure.

Absolute positioning not using left/right insets:

If the plate is position: absolute but sized by width alone, small calculation errors or transforms can keep it narrow. Prefer left/right insets within a bottom “name band” wrapper.

Transforms or scale on the plate/parent (e.g., transform: scale() or translate) that effectively reduce available width.

Tailwind/utility classes still capping width (max-w-*, w-auto, self-center, items-center) or adding unintended padding/margins.

4) Required layout structure (target)

Tile: position: relative.

Name band wrapper: anchored to the bottom, spans full tile width (inside tile padding), defines the band height (≈ 24–30% of tile height, clamped).

Plate: inside the band, block-level (not inline), centered, width ≈ 94% of the band’s inner width (after band padding), small bottom margin (≈ 3–4% of tile width).

Text container: fills plate 100% width, min-width: 0, with small responsive inner padding (≈ 1.5–2.5% per side).

Key point: The plate width must be determined by horizontal insets (left/right) or an explicit percentage in a container that itself fills the tile. It must not be sized by its own content.

5) Dynamic font auto-fit (integration)

Reuse our existing auto-fit logic, but re-measure against the plate’s inner width (after padding).

Start from a higher max font now that the plate is wider.

Keep the dynamic name order:

one-line full

two-line full

one-line truncated

two-line truncated

No hyphenation; truncate only end of last name.

Ensure the name band height limits are respected so we never collide with the avatar or badge.

6) Measurement ordering (prevents stale/incorrect sizes)

After layout changes, measure with requestAnimationFrame (or LayoutEffect equivalent) so CSS is applied first.

On iOS Safari, use getBoundingClientRect() for accurate fractional pixels.

Re-fit when:

tile/name band resizes (ResizeObserver),

avatar image loads,

window resize/orientation change,

grid regenerates.

Debounce ~50ms to avoid jitter.

7) iOS-specific polish

Ensure -webkit-text-size-adjust: 100% is set globally so Safari doesn’t auto-bump text.

Avoid overflow: hidden on ancestors that could clip the plate’s glow/shadow (if any).

Verify no Safari transform side-effects on measuring elements.

8) Quick self-test checklist (use the A. Davis tile)

Tile plate width visually ≈ 94% of tile width (narrow left/right margins).

“A. Davis” appears larger and uses nearly full width; on small tiles it picks the right mode from the dynamic order.

Plate remains in the bottom band, not floating upward.

No overlap with avatar or top-right rarity badge.

Rotating iPhone 16 and resizing desktop reflows perfectly.

9) If still narrow after changes

Temporarily add a debug outline to the name band and the plate so you can see actual widths on device. If the band is full width but the plate isn’t, a lingering max-width/w-auto/inline-flex is still active—remove it.

If the band itself isn’t full width, check the tile’s inner container for padding/constraints and fix that first.

End result: The name plate truly spans almost the full tile width on iPhone 16 (and everywhere), the text auto-fits to that wider space, and everything continues to respect our safe-zones and dynamic name rules.
