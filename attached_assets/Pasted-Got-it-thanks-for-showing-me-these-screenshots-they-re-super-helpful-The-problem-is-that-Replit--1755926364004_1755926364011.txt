Got it — thanks for showing me these screenshots, they’re super helpful. The problem is that Replit is still ranking these players as if higher WS = rarer, when it should be the opposite (higher WS = more common, lower WS = rarer). That’s why stars like KAT, Embiid, and Edwards are all getting “Ultra rare!” when they’re actually some of the most obvious/common picks.

Here’s exactly how you should phrase it to the Replit AI bot so it fixes rarity once and for all:

Copy-paste for Replit AI:

We need to fix the rarity calculation. Right now, high-win-share superstars are being ranked as “Ultra rare,” which is backwards.

Here’s what should happen:
	•	The game already fetches the list of all eligible players for a cell (this is how we populate “Other Top Answers”).
	•	Use that same list and sort it by career Win Shares, descending (highest WS = most common, lowest WS = rarest).
	•	A player’s rank in that sorted list should be used to calculate their rarity percentile.

Formula (most common = 0, rarest = 100):

rarity = round(100 * (eligibleCount - rank) / (eligibleCount - 1))

	•	rank = 1 means the most common pick (highest WS).
	•	rank = eligibleCount means the rarest pick (lowest WS).

Examples:
	•	If there are 200 eligible players and LeBron (highest WS) is guessed, his rarity should be 0.
	•	If the player ranked 100th is guessed, their rarity should be 50.
	•	If the lowest WS scrub (rank 200) is guessed, their rarity should be 100.

What to update in the UI:
	•	On the grid tile, the rarity score should show this correct percentile.
	•	On the player modal, under the “Rarity” section, display the descriptive tier:
	•	0–9: Ultra common
	•	10–24: Very common
	•	25–39: Common
	•	40–59: Notable
	•	60–74: Rare
	•	75–89: Very rare
	•	90–100: Ultra rare
	•	Also show:

Ranked X out of Y eligible players for this cell



Important: Please make sure the rarity calculation is using all eligible players from the existing list, not just the top 10 shown in the modal.

Would you like me to also rewrite this with an additional debugging instruction so you can see the sorted list + WS values in console logs and confirm Replit is using the full eligible list before computing rarity? That could guarantee no more hidden bugs.
